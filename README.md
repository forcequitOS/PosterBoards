# PosterBoard Experiments
.imazingapp files for various PosterBoard configurations I've made.

For .imazingapp files, restore them with iMazing (preferably the latest version of iMazing 2 as it's more stable and faster for this).

For .tendies files, restore them with Nugget 5.0 or higher (in beta at time of writing).

At the time of writing this, to restore with Nugget you have to reset the PRB Extension data before any video wallpapers appear.
