# PosterBoard Experiments
.imazingapp files for various PosterBoard configurations I've made.

For .imazingapp files, restore them with iMazing (preferably the latest version of iMazing 2 as it's more stable and faster for this).

For .tendies files, restore them with Nugget 5.0 or higher. (in beta at time of writing)
